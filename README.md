# KNN-in-R
In this particular project, I was given a random training dataset and a test data set and classified two different classes using K-Nearest Neighbors method. 
I found the optimal K value and identified training and test errorates associated with the optimal K. 
I also made a plot of traning data that shows the decision boundary for the optimal K.
